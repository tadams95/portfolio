# _Tyrelle Adams_

How's it going, my name is Ty and I'm a Full Stack _Web3_ Developer. I'm passionate about the Web3 space and enjoy building functional projects that make an impact.

Head on over to the **Projects** tab to look at some of my works and in the **Posts** tab you'll see some of my blog posts.

In the **Certificates** tab you'll find out about some of the technologies/frameworks I've learned.

The **Projects** tab includes some of the works I've completed and put out there on the internet.

 And in the **Posts** tab you'll read some of my thoughts either about the courses I've taken or the Web3 space.
