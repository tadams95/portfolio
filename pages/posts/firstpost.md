# Tyrelle's Blogs: #1

## This is my first blog post ever. NGL, just stating that is a bit cringey but here we are ðŸ˜…

#### As I write this, I'm beginning to form ideas of how I want to structure the blog posts. Part of it will likely be something to document my journey while becoming a more experienced developer. Part of it will be my thoughts and opinions while working on different projects. 

#### The purpose of not only this blog but the site this blog is on is to have a personal site and record of the work I have done. I think the standard of any Web Developer aiming to fulfil a role is to have their own personal site to prove that they know what they're doing to any potential recruiter and/or hiring manager, so here is mine.

#### While I may not have the "formal" education experience of a college degree, I have dedicated an ample amount of time to learning web development frameworks to achieve some desired outcome. That experience will very likely be spread out over multiple blog posts. To go into detail about one for now, it'll have to be this Nextra framework. 

#### I've worked with Next and Vercel products for various projects and knowing that I needed a personal site I pretty much used Vercel's Portfolio Starter kit to get me up and running. It took me a couple tries to set up the development environment for it to work for me. I ran into some problems after git cloning the site into VSCode and for some reason I wasn't able to run it locally. Even after git cloning it then pushing code remotely caused the deployment to fail on Vercel's site. This was very frustrating at first but over time I found a workaround.

#### While this workaround is likely inefficient for a more seasoned dev, its been able to serve my purposes. Essentially, I first deployed the starter kit which created a repository in my GitHub. This is my Production code since it works and this site is that code. Then I just downloaded the .zip files from GitHub to use in VSCode which was able to be ran locally. Somewhere within this process of either cloning then remote pushing to Git causes the entire deployment to fail so I'm going to stick with the process that works and keeps the site functional.

#### Going forward, I aim to have more blog posts and continue adding onto my portfolio. Below are some of the projects I'll be working on.
