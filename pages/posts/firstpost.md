# Building This Portfolio

## Documenting my journey into web development — starting with this site.

This blog will serve two purposes: documenting my growth as a developer and sharing thoughts on the projects I'm working on.

Every web developer needs a portfolio to demonstrate their skills. This is mine.

I've invested significant time mastering web development frameworks through self-directed learning. I'll share detailed breakdowns in future posts, starting with the Nextra framework that powers this site.

I chose Vercel's Portfolio Starter kit to get up and running quickly. Setting up the local dev environment took a few attempts — cloning then pushing to Git caused deployment failures. My workaround: deploy the starter kit first (creating the production repo), then download the zip to work locally. Not elegant, but functional.

Next up: more posts, more projects.
