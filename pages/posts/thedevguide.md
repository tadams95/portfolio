# Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide

## The course that taught me full-stack Web3 development from A to Z.

My previous Solidity course covered smart contract basics but didn't teach frontend integration. Writing contracts is one thing — connecting them to a React app that users can actually interact with is another.

Stephen Grider's course nails this. It walks through the full stack: writing contracts, deploying them, and building frontends that interact with them. The previous course gave me the fundamentals — Truffle, Remix, testnet interaction, troubleshooting — which proved invaluable here.

The course is somewhat outdated. Hitting deprecated packages and broken builds is frustrating, but it mirrors real development. Debugging dependency issues is a skill in itself.

Deployment challenges with the final project led me to discover I could easily deploy a portfolio site through Vercel — which became this site. Development isn't linear; detours often lead somewhere meaningful.

The course strengthened my confidence in Web3 development. I don't have it all memorized, but repetition builds mastery. Highly recommended for learning Ethereum, Solidity, React, and Next.js together.

Next: deploying the course's final project, adding it to my Projects tab, and rebuilding my e-commerce site.
